LuaSublime
==========

Description
-----------

These are a collection of various different support files useful for developing Lua using Sublime Text 2.

Installation
------------

These files should be placed into the Lua package directory. For those on OS X, this can be found at:

`/Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Lua`

For Windows, this directory is here:

`C:\\Users\\[USERNAME]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sublime Text 2\\Packages\\Lua`

Contents

### Syntax Coloring

`Lua.tmLanguage`
`Lua.JSON-tmLanguage`

These files define a language grammar for syntax highlighting lua files. Compared to the one that ships with Sublime Text, you get the following:

- *More tokens*: Things like function calls and variables are now tagged, so they will show up correctly colored.
- *Better scopes*: Most blocks now have some nested scoping support. This means that if you're in an if-block inside a function inside another function, then it knows this. Visually there's no difference, but if you use the expand-scope command then you will find that you'll get far better matches now.

### Build System

`Lua.sublime-build`

This is a build system that runs the current lua file

### Live Parser

`ParseLua.py`

This is a plugin that continually parses the current lua file and highlights any errors by placing a dot in the margin. Lua appears to stop at the first error, so you should only ever see one dot. The error message will be shown in the status bar.
